//Methods are similar to functions: we declare them with the fn keyword and a name, 
//they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code thatâ€™s run 
//when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions, methods are defined 
//within the context of a struct (or an enum which we cover in Chapter 6), and their 
//first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the type the 
//method is being called on.
